I am the only group member and I wasn't sure how to find my number so I put my last name for the filenames.
maincode.py has all of the code, the only input it requires is recording sound and a yes to do the delays and save all of the files.  you do have to put your own filepath into it.
The code runs on python 3.11 because some of the dependencies don't work on 3.12
